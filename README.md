# Demonic descent

## About
Demonic descent was supposed to be a 2D turn based roguelike / dungeon crawler with procedurally generated maps.  
I'm not working on the project anymore as the scope has been defined as too big for a one person job. It contains  
a lot of neat features that I learned over the course of the development (procedural layout generation,  
A* pathfinding, combat queue system & visualisation (I spent a lot of time on that one), experimented with visuals,  
tilemaps and much more).  
  
Here is the last footage I mustered when opening up the project after a long time:
